# Learning Turi Create

Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app.

Recommender systems

A recommender system allows you to provide personalized recommendations to users. With this toolkit, you can create a model based on past interaction data and use that model to make recommendations.
